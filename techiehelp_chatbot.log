INFO:root:Time: 2024-09-10 15:43:35.603164, User Query: what is machine learning, AI Response: Hi, I'm a friendly AI model. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values. The goal is to have computers imitate intelligent human behavior and perform complex tasks in a way that is similar to how humans solve problems.
